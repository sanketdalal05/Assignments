    <!-- 4. Make a variable whose value is an object with firstName and lastName properties, but don't define a Person class first. Try looking up the first and last names. Try changing the last name. It seems very odd to Java programmers to make an object without first defining a class, but JavaScript pro grammers do this sort of thing all the time. -->
