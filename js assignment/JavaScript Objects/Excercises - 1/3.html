    <!-- 3. Assuming that the Rectangle constructor takes a width and a height, why does the following output 20 instead of 200? (Hint: if you see an answer that seems too obvious to be what I am looking for, it probably is the answer I am looking for.)
    Rectangle r = new Rectangle (4, 5); r.hieght = 50;
    r.getArea (): 20 // Not 200 -->
