    <!--4. Create a JS program to implement below:

        BankAccount
            | (accountNumber)
            | (accountHolderName)
            | (accountBalance)
    ------------------------------
    |                   |
    Savings             Current
        (isSalary)          (odLimit)

    Now,
    create 1 object of savings with account Number, accountHolderName, accountBalance and isSalary.
    create 1 object of currrent with account Number, accountHolderName, account Balance and odLimit.

    use savings account object to call a function withdraw(amount), that will subtract the amount from the accountBalance, Note that accountBalance should not go below 0.
    use current account object to calla function withdraw(amount), that will subtract the amount from the accountBalance, Note that accountBalance should not go below negative of od Limit.

    Now, call getCurrentBalance() from both the object, that will return the accountBalance of the object used to call this method. -->
